#  Notes

1.  Used 3rd party library SwiftCSV for some handy reading of the text file into CSV format - please make sure the package is installed properly before running.  File->Packages->Resolve Package versions

2.  For this project, to save time, I treated the entire text file as valid or invalid (i.e. if one set is invalid, the entire file read would fail)

3.  I did not optimize fonts for iPAD but it still should work properly

4.  Extra: Added a few Unit tests

5.  Extra: Added ability to edit range of display for chart

6.  Mockup is dark background - which is how it looks in dark mode, otherwise it'll be light background
